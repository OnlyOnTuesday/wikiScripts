A small plan of sorts I guess.

I think we should make an abstract class that can be a super to two smaller classes.
One of those smaller classes would be the current one that gathers the quote, and the other
one would be a class that gathers the image from wikiversity.

The super class would have the methods to go online, sort read and
write a database, and sort through html, though the last two would
probably have to be implemented at the concrete level, as opposed to
the abstract.

The name of the database would also have to be passed in at the
concrete level (wouldn't the url too?).  This is just the small plan
right now.  I'll plan the actual classes tomorrow.
