class wikiImage():

      what should it do?
	   grab the image from wikiversity and /display save it.

      How should it save the image?:
      	  *save the image file to a directory in the filesystem.
	  *save the path to the file in a database, along with the
      	  date. (the path should begin in the current directory, and
      	  can't be changed once I begin using the db.)
	  	what should the file structure be then?
	
      How should it display the image?
      	  *pillow can open images, but that will open it in the image
      	  viewer, which I don't like all that much.  Maybe there's a
      	  way to change this.
	  *os.system can call a command to have a specific application
      	  open the image (like a shell command)


	  *I might also need to work with my xmonad configuration to
           get it to float the window, so that the window doesn't
           become bigger than the image.  I'm not sure, I'll come back
           to this
