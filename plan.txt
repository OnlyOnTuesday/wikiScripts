class wikiImage():

      what should it do?
	   grab the image from wikiversity and /display save it.

      How should it save the image?:
      	  *save the image file to a directory in the filesystem.
	  *save the path to the file in a database, along with the
      	  date. (the path should begin in the current directory, and
      	  can't be changed once I begin using the db.)
	  	what should the file structure be then?
	
      How should it display the image?
      	  *pillow can open images, but that will open it in the image
      	  viewer, which I don't like all that much.  Maybe there's a
      	  way to change this.
	  *os.system can call a command to have a specific application
      	  open the image (like a shell command)


	  *I might also need to work with my xmonad configuration to
           get it to float the window, so that the window doesn't
           become bigger than the image.  I'm not sure, I'll come back
           to this 
	  




What variables will I need?:
     parent vars:
     	    request
	    content
     child vars:
     	    path
	    the image in a buffer
	    the database connection

how should the image be saved to the file?:
    the file should be created first
    the image should then be saved to the file using the PIL function
	Does the file need to be created before, or can it be created
	on the fly?
	   the file doesn't need to be created first. As long as a
    file path is given it should save

How do I get the downloaded image into a PIL object variable? I
suppose I should search through the html for it first.

BUGS:
	python requests module isn't downloading the updated html. For
	some  reason it consistently provides me with the htlm from
	yesterday's wikiversity main page (the image provided is
	yesterday's). No one seems to have a similar enough problem
	for me to find the answer online so this may take some time.

	the response cookies list {"Last-Modified":"Sun, 23 Jun 2019
	18:01:03 GMT"}.  Today is Friday. I wonder if that has
	anything to do with my problem.
	I wonder if the server that I'm in contact with just doesn't
	have an updated version.  That would be annoying and I don't
	know why it wouldn't, but anyway.
