A small plan of sorts I guess.

I think we should make an abstract class that can be a super to two smaller classes.
One of those smaller classes would be the current one that gathers the quote, and the other
one would be a class that gathers the image from wikiversity.

The super class would have the methods to go online, sort read and
write a database, and sort through html, though the last two would
probably have to be implemented at the concrete level, as opposed to
the abstract.

The name of the database would also have to be passed in at the
concrete level (wouldn't the url too?).  This is just the small plan
right now.  I'll plan the actual classes tomorrow.


What can GetWiki do right now?:
     get a web page
     check the database
     save to the database


What can wikiQuote do right now?:
     Find a quote nested in html
     Find a quote stored in the database

What do they still need to do?:
     get the database(?)


DEBUGGING:
	I need to know what the content is in order to pass it to the
	super class, but I need to the super class to init first.  How
	can I solve this.  I think I can write a method to grab the
	information later from the child in the parent.  How do I do
	this?
